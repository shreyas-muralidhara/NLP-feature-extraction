20s1x1,cg6ay9r,cg6f18i,n_244708,q_30570,"&gt; Hello! Both my major AND my minor are due to classes I took at the time for general ed. requirements.

There's some things you don't get to learn in high school which it's really useful to know. Taking, say, a single class in CS is incredibly useful later on in a whole range of things: a basic ability to program is useful even if you don't intend to do it for a living. 

This is true to a greater or lesser degree for most classes: being somewhat able to analyze the themes in a work of art is going to get you way more happiness later in life than a 21st biology course even if you end up working in biology. Obviously basic calculus and statistics are useful. A little bit of ethical training (philosophy!) can be useful in almost any job as well as in everyday life. In short small amounts of nearly any field are generally more useful than slightly more information about a field you already are learning tons about.", Can you illustrate how a single class in CS would be incredibly useful in a whole range of things?," Your statement that way more happiness is achieved through analysis of themes of art rather than biology is subjective. I also think that reinforcing and advancing one's knowledge in a single field of information is beneficial rather than redundant, as you imply. I don't see the harm in producing college graduates who are extremely well-versed in their given field.","Oh gods yes. First of all, most students aren't required to take a CS class the same as regular CS students, they take a <&quot;>kinda everything about computer technology at a high level<&quot;> which will give them at least some basic skills in understanding how computers work and some major types of software and technology.

I think this depends entirely on what kind of situation you're talking about. Are you envisioning a conventional North vs South war? Sure, that probably wouldn't go down in a way the South would enjoy.

On the other hand, if it turns into more of an Algeria versus France situation - terrorist southerners who command the sympathy of a substantial portion of the population, and are willing to commit some heinous acts to weaken the resolve of the people trying to keep them by force?

2s311o,cnmgz0s,cnmhetb,n_635431,q_78699,"&gt; CMV: No one should be complaining about public schools when alternatives exist that they're not willing to take advantage of.

Public schools exist to provide education to poor families that can't afford alternatives. It's a program meant for the less-fortunate, which makes perfect sense considering education for children must be provided under penalty of incarceration. Parents that have any problems with what's being taught have every right to educate their children themselves or send them to a private school, public education isn't being forced on anyone.  

School prayer advocates should be sending their children to christian schools, and if they can't afford it always have the option to homeschool. The fact that they aren't indicates that they're either trying to unlawfully indoctrinate other people's children against their parent's will, or haven't figured out that beggars can't be choosey. 

Government provided education reflects the views of the government providing it. Secular, non-segregated, fact-based, and functional even to the point of inefficiency. If it's operating outside of those boundaries it's cause for concern and should be corrected. If anybody has a problem with that they've missed the point of public schools (and the US government). 

But hey, now with homeschooling being available now even the poor have an alternative to public school, therefore everyone should be happy. Anyone complaining now clearly just want to have their cake and eat it too. 

EDIT: This issue is stemming from a view I already hold that others don't. I do not feel the few cents of mine that end up in the budget entitles me to demand the government be run the way I see fit regardless of the elected officials or the law in general. If the majority votes representatives in that won't be spending the way I'd like them to it's my duty to eat shit until the next election and hope my side wins next time, those that expect any different are going to have a bad time. 

Also, parents might feel more comfortable with their children learning things that can be taught in private schools but can't afford to homeschool or pay for private education, IMO that's too bad and parents will just have to unteach the stuff they don't like when the kids get home. It's what happens when you can't afford something you want, you settle for what's available, which when talking about public school isn't half bad. 

My view has been changed though, haters gonna hate, lovers gonna love and that's their right as Americans.

381ey6,crs3bnm,crs4d1g,n_65546,q_8862,"&gt; &gt; Is a meta-review of studies published after the one you posted (thus likely containing the data from that study), and they report that the high-quality studies <&quot;>uniformly found that circumcision had no overall adverse effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, sexual sensation, erectile function, premature ejaculation, ejaculatory latency, orgasm difficulties, sexual satisfaction, pleasure, or pain during penetration.<&quot;>

Brian J Morris is well known for his activity in circumcision fetishist circles including but not limited to the Gilgal society; an organization who's head director was recently brought up on charges involving child pornography.

There have been numerous and thorough rebuttals / critiques of Morris' work. Here is a choice selection of that exact meta study you just linked,

&gt;  By contrast, a comprehensive, critical, and nuanced discussion of the available evidence concerning the various sexual (and other) effects of circumcision can be seen in the recent work of Bossio et al. (20). As these authors note, a previous âsystematic reviewâ by Morris and Krieger (75), the first of whom is a long-time advocate of neonatal circumcision (12, 76), *is ânot a meta-analysis, thus, no statistical analyses of the data have been performed; instead,* ***the article presents the authorsâ interpretation of trends.â*** Problematically, however, ***âMorris and Krieger do not report the results of this review collapsed across study quality. The conclusion they draw â that circumcision has no impact on sexual functioning, sensitivity, or sexual satisfaction â does not necessarily line up with the information presented in their review, which is mixedâ*** 

Emphasis my own. For the Tian study I have seen refutations of the meta-analysis but I cannot find the specific papers this moment (will have to do some digging). IIRC, the criticisms were more or less identical to the ones lobbied against Morris, however that'll mostly be a dead point for the time being.

In my experience (having reviewed most of the literature available) when the academia surrounding circumcision at present is examined with a fair and honest eye and is actually pulled apart by its fundamental threads, it quickly falls in on itself. These studies tend to arrive at their results by manipulating the presentation of data, and careful methodological set-up to impart a pro-circumcision bias. 

For example, one of the most commonly referenced studies to conclude no change in penile sensitivity due to circumcision, didn't actually measure the effects of circumcision on the sensitivity and function of the penis *as a whole intact organ*, and only studied the impact of circumcision, *on the structures that remain after*. They tested touch sensitivity of the glans penis, of part of the outer remaining shaft skin (near the base), and of a control location on the forearm. They found these locations in both circumcised and intact men to show similar touch sensitivity, and thus concluded circumcision does not impact the sexual sensitivity of the penis. This conclusion is as dishonest as it is a misrepresentation of data, as it critically failed to examine the sexual sensitivity of the tissue actually ablated by the operation.

&gt; I don't find HIV protection <&quot;>ludicrous<&quot;>. The CDC estimates 1.2 million Americans have HIV. Granted, that's less than 1%, but as someone in a higher-risk group I both practice safe sex and see any added protection whatsoever as beneficial.

Then you simply do not understand where the HIV <&quot;>benefit<&quot;> comes from, nor the nuances of endemic disease transmission. Circumcision has show efficacy against HIV in populations suffering from endemic levels of the virus, in the female to male direction only. HIV is not transmitted this way in first world nations; it's primary vector of transmission is from homosexual anal penetrative intercourse, and sharing of infected hypodermic needles by drug addicted individuals. Neither of these things are impacted by circumcision in the slightest, and this is exactly why the USA has the highest prevalence of HIV in the developed world, despite also having the greatest rate of circumcision. *It simply is not an effective HIV prevention strategy in first world nations*. There has *never* been a study to demonstrate a protective effect in a first world population. I would invite you to find such a study, as far as I'm aware none exist. This benefit is exclusive to areas of endemic HIV. 

Further still, none of these benefits (even if we ignored the fact they do not have any proven application whatsoever to first world populations) are applicable to infants. I would be very much for offering circumcision to people at the age of 15 or 16, provided they were educated on both the pros (potential STI protection benefit) and the cons (reduction of sexual function, sensation, and other adverse complications) in an honest manner. There is no sound, ethical argument to perform this procedure without medical indication in infancy.

These two papers [Here](https://www.academia.edu/9603843/Do_the_benefits_of_male_circumcision_outweigh_the_risks_A_critique_of_the_proposed_CDC_guidelines) and [Here](https://www.academia.edu/9872471/Does_science_support_infant_circumcision) are a good introduction to all the competing narratives and critical flaws in the arguments for circumcision as they currently stand. There are many more I would recommend investigating, but these two are short and easy to digest (versus wading through technical histological reports for example), and will hammer out all the key arguments you should be thinking about.

If you would like to learn a bit more about the sexual consequences of circumcision, I can certainly speak at length about that both from academic knowledge, and from personal experience. I'm circumcised, was a birth, and never thought much of it. I didn't consider my sexual experience to be lacking, had no <&quot;>textbook<&quot;> complications, and was lucky to be given a high and loose cut leaving me an <&quot;>okay<&quot;> amount of tissue (compared to the low and tight cut which leaves almost no sexually sensitive inner mucosa and often very tight and uncomfortable erections). I'm a very long way through the process of restoring my foreskin, and have experienced first hand what its like to have a glans that is covered all day, before being exposed for sex. I have understood not only intellectually, but with my flesh, what all that extra skin actually does. I can confidently (and begrudgingly) say that the two are not comparable. 

Sex as a normal, <&quot;>cleanly<&quot;> circumcised man is not sex at all. They are fundamentally different experiences at every level. The depth and breadth of sensation is remarkable, far beyond what I'd ever hoped or imagined I'd get back when I started this journey 2.5 years ago. I could write and write about it, but words simply do not do it justice. If you could feel what I do now, you would not be so apathetic. But that's the problem isn't it? You only really have my word, and the word of other men who stuck out this process and restored themselves to go on, and it's no quick and easy process. Depending on the nature of your circumcision, you might be able to half-ass it and experience a small piece of what I'm talking about. If you have enough skin to comfortably pull it forward over your glans when soft, then you can retain (hold it there) with an O-ring, or some other gentle elastic. If you can do this for most of the day for a few days, then on the last day (after a few hours of wearing it), you'll be able to pull your skin back to unveil your glans which should by then have softened and become at least a bit moistened by your inner mucosa. I'll never forget the first time I did this when I finally had enough skin to retain fulltime. Feeling the skin gently pulling on my glans as I rolled it back sent shivers deep into my groin and spine, springing me to one of the fullest and most rock-solid erections I'd ever had up until then. It was in that moment I knew that I wouldn't stop restoring until I was complete, and things have only skyrocketed since then.

I doubt you'll take me up on that offer (if you even have enough tissue left to do so without restoring for a few months first), but despite that I can still demonstrate exactly what the functional difference is, should you want to hear it.

There are exceptions all over the place, but a successful non-monogamous relationship requires involved parties to grow and overcome things like jealousy, envy, insecurity, and possessiveness. 

For this reason, I feel that the average person in a non-monogamous relationship will be of a stronger character than their monogamous counterpart.

1h0dvp,caplvg0,capsxdz,n_490279,q_60824,"&gt; I believe women are more valued than men in western society. CMV!

I know this topic may be an eye-roller or seen as juvenile, but I find myself too engrossed in this view and I find it to be an unhealthy belief for someone to have. So CMV please!

Now I understand that many of these views are simply cultural and are not inherent human traits, but I would like to frame these points in the realm of modern western culture.

I think females have higher value in western society because: 

- Men must pay up at parties, bars, and other social settings while women get in cheap or free. Women are simply more desirable to have at social settings than men are.

- The sex industry serves men. In a capitalist society, this translates to women being a scarcity and in demand. Excuse the crudeness, but there is the saying <&quot;>pussy costs money, but dick is free.<&quot;>

- There are 105 men for every 100 women born. In the most active and productive years of their lives, men outnumber women, thus adding to the value of being female.

- Women are given a substantial amount of attention in certain communities, like Reddit and tech-related interests. Because of this, women interested in sports, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable. I cannot think of equivalent communities where men are as <&quot;>in demand<&quot;> and desirable. 

- There are three times as many Male-to-Female trans operations than there are Female-to-Male [questionable statistic]. I see this as women being the more desirable gender.

- Women definitively represent sexually desire, even to other women. The amount of bi-sexual women strongly outnumbers the amount of bi-sexual men [anecdotal observation]. A woman's body is considered sexy and beautiful; a man's is not.

- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man. For example, Reddit posts with attractive women in them become much more popular than they would be otherwise. 

- The old saying <&quot;>women and children first<&quot;> reinforces the value of females over males. Society prefers that women live over men. We would rather send our men to war and have men do dangerous jobs.

- Female crime victims get more media attention than male ones. 

- Similarly, female social issues get more media attention. Feminism, breast cancer, glass ceiling, etc. Male issues do not get this much attention.

- Simply that men are seen as the <&quot;>default<&quot;> human being implies that women are special.

- For a man to gain value, he must prove himself. Women have more value by default due to their scarcity and sexual desirability.

I feel that there is something very wrong with thinking this way, but no matter how much I've tried to convince myself otherwise, I can't see past it. As a man, I don't feel valued or desired and it saddens me. It is difficult to discuss this in other communities without being seen as juvenile or troll-bait for gender wars, so I hope this subreddit can help! CMV please!","The best way I heard someone put this was: <&quot;>So you think women have it better just because you want to fuck them?<&quot;>

3ags1g,csciir3,cscj3px,n_52217,q_7100,"&gt; CMV: I believe that child labor should be reinstated for children as young as 10

Child labor was outlawed in the first place because poor children were working in factories and getting injured. They were also not getting an education.

But times have changed since the turn of the 20th century. There are few factories left in America, most employ very few people, and most have very safe working conditions for those that do work there. Most kids that decided to earn money at a young age would not be working in factories.

I want child labor to be reinstated because I don't believe a high school or even middle school education is necessary for every person to live a happy and successful life. In today's world, we tend to define success as the amount of money one earns; but we know this to be faulty, we know that one does not need to earn lots of money to be successful and happy. Instead of forcing kids to waste years learning things like biology and chemistry that, while interesting and valuable to the right person, offer no value to them, they should be able to instead pursue training and employment in jobs that suit them. Kids could go to work instead as a plumber, a roofer, a landscaper, a mason. These are jobs that pay well and are in perpetual demand, and getting a head start in these fields would be desirable to them as adults.

Most college kids enter the workforce at age 22, with tens of thousand in debt and only a bleak job market awaiting them. A kid that did a 2 year apprenticeship with a plumber starting at age 10 and that continued working as a plumber afterward would reach 22 with a dozen years of experience in his field and a decade's worth of wages, with employment opportunities everywhere in the country.

The fact is that a carefree childhood cannot be given to every kid. When you have kids that *don't want* to be in school, they impede learning for those that do want to be there and get into trouble outside the school. It is far better to give them valuable experiences that will pay off later in life instead of forcing them into environments that they have no desire to be in at all.

Now, let me preempt the obvious downside; child exploitation. The way I would implement child labor to avoid exploitation is as follows: the child and all his/her custodial guardians must both give written consent on an official government document for the child to get working papers to do the work. Then, if at any time the child expresses to his employer that he is unhappy working or doesn't not want to continue work, the employer would be required by law to end the child's employment and report to the government that the child had declined to continue work. Failure by the employer to terminate the employment would result in criminal penalties.

Change my view!", Why would you want to live in a country full of uneducated people who are allowed to vote?,I want my fellow citizens educated because their vote is equal to mine and it is a fact that the better educated you are the less likely you are to be manipulated by bullshit. How can a person tell the difference between a politician spouting nonsense of they have no education? Allowing child labor because people don't need education is the kind of thing that sounds good to the uneducated but is obviously ridiculous to anyone with half a brain.,"I already do. I live in America. If you think the electorate in America is currently educated, then please get me some evidence of that. Studies have consistently shown that voters are ignorant of the issues. Also, just having kids sit in a classroom does not make them educated. If the kids don't want to be there, then they can drop out and work instead.

This is where my thought get's a bit branched to seeking an answer(even though it's beyond the purview on my original CMV question): Now that we can safely say **there** will always be exploitative elements since we cannot be forever naive and assume there will be no exploitative elements, so with that said why are there large scale attempts by people to stop mass surveillance(even if it did get derailed recently) it would be inevitably brought back because of the basic fear of any vested parties to lose control in an event they cannot show they did everything they could to prevent an attack(mass surveillance at this point is a blanket defense to saying we are literally doing everything we can). Every time I see these kinds of petitions/activism to stop mass surveillance, I can never figure out what side they are on. At this point even if a society was able to get to the point that mass surveillance would be made illegal, all it's doing is prolonging when it's brought back secretly in an event of a next attack as you hypothetically mentioned","Wouldn't it be exponentially easier if they created a whole new legal framework to ban/prevent as many possible exploitative actions that can be utilized?, for example, create a whole new ethical framework (which btw I still cannot believe does not exist) when it comes to implementing mass surveillance.","Negotiate a way to install an independent over watch committee answerable to civilians.

1x4cd6,cf8cmgj,cf8d97x,n_285829,q_35650,"&gt; I believe domain name speculation is evil. CMV.

First, I'll say I think there are degrees of <&quot;>evil<&quot;> and domain name speculators are far less evil than, say, Pol Pot.

Obviously it's a deep philosophical question, but I think one reasonable layman's definition of evil is, <&quot;>Intentionally doing harm to others for one's own benefit,<&quot;> where we can quibble about what counts as <&quot;>harm<&quot;> and <&quot;>benefit.<&quot;>

And domain name speculating qualifies. It is purely parasitic; it provides nothing of value to anyone but the squatter, and causes harm (in the form of extracting what amounts to a ransom payment) to individuals and businesses who want to use the name to refer to an actual online service of some kind. It also clutters up the domain name system and makes it much harder to gather certain kinds of statistics about the growth of the Internet.

Another litmus test: if domain name speculation were somehow ended tomorrow, a bunch of people would benefit and there would be absolutely no downside to anyone except the speculators. There isn't, as far as I can tell, any argument that they produce useful side-effects like improving market liquidity (as has been said about high-frequency stock traders).

I think the politics in America has become a force that inhibits competent governance for all citizens. 

I simply believe that there are too many people of different political opinions to address the concerns of our citizens properly. Since many of these differences of opinions are predicted by geographical region, I think it would be wise to break up the United States. 

Let me elaborate further. For example, let the New England area become its own country, or even join with Canada for that matter should they desire to. The makeup of this area of the country is being hurt by the rest of the country. The policies they wish to see implemented are being blocked by other groups of people hundreds or even thousands of miles away. 

Likewise for the South. If the majority of people in the South want less government, and to let religion be a powerful force in their politics, why not let them? Why should people far away deny them of this?

I also think we would do the world a favor by breaking apart militarily. Perhaps we can remain a continental coalition militarily, but a large part of the country would never commit their troops to another engagement like Vietnam or Iraq, thus limiting the scale of which <&quot;>America<&quot;> could be involved in a conflict. This arrangement could also allow unity among N. America should a conflict arise that all of us need to participate in.

1kwatf,cbu4kpl,cbu4nl6,n_432049,q_53683,"&gt; &gt;I'm not sure what you mean by <&quot;>actual rape<&quot;> either it's an actual rape or a false accusation. So if we assume 8% were false accusations, then all of the rest were <&quot;>actually rape<&quot;>. There's no fallacy here on that.

You don't seem to understand - some rape reports end in conviction, and those we know are fairly certain to be actual rape (of course, false convictions exist but let's ignore that).  And then there are the rape claims that are proven to be false.

In between, is the majority of rape reports - which are never proven one way or another.

You have assumed that all rape reports that are not proven to be false, are true - which is a fallacious assumption.  Get it?

&gt;Actually no, based on the sources of that 5 - 8% number, that's the upper bound as it still includes some claims that were possibly not false accusations but simply did not have enough evidence to prove in a court that it was rape. 

No...you are ignorant on this issue.

&gt;To classify a case as a false allegation,
a thorough investigation must yield evidence that a crime did not occur. 

&gt;âEvidence that the assault did not happenâ might include, for example, physical evi-
dence and/or statements from credible witnesses that contradict key aspects of a victimâs account. Such evidence would be distinct from more general âcredibilityâ evidence, for
example, a delayed report; an apparent inconsistency in the victimâs statement â which has
often been used by police investigators to discount a rape victimâs report

http://www.icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf

The 5-8% is the lower bound.

&gt;It's only slightly higher than the false accusation rate of other crimes like murder, that's pretty damn low.

The false accusation rate of other crimes is 2%.

&gt; Why? They are most definitely relevant when speaking in general about rapes and rapists and the fact that if so few rapes are even reported, why do we want to give people even more reason to be afraid of reporting them?

Unreported rapes are irrelevant, since we want to know what the frequency is of a rape claim being false.  It is yet another fallacy for you to go <&quot;>LOLOLOL millions of women don't report rape, which is why it's wrong to punish false rape acccusers<&quot;>.

&gt;Except anonymity was added for rape victims in order to get more people to report them and it worked!

Rape is a special crime - which is why accusers get anonymity, rape shield laws, etc. etc.  You, and people like you, support that.

Then suddenly <&quot;>why should rapists get special treatment?<&quot;>", Why is it one or the other?,"Why would the victim not be shielded unless they discover it was a false claim, in which case they would then release the name and no longer afford that anonymity?",It is not one or the other.,answered

Currently I'd estimate a single user's <&quot;>need<&quot;> at 5 Mbps so with 2 people in the house our 10 Mb connection works just fine.  That's based on streaming content, since large downloads are relatively more rare and can normally be scheduled for when the service is otherwise unused.  When 4k Netflix and holographic Skype become the norm, that estimate will obviously need to be adjusted.

What I find more troublesome is the way that the simultaneous use of multiple services will degrade performance even while operating under one's bandwidth limit.

3dvguq,ct90y8o,ct9191h,n_31778,q_4386,"&gt; CMV: Keynesian economics is a thin cover for class warfare

This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.

My understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.

Once recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.

From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only whatâs absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.

At this point, I see five possibilities:

1.	Keynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 
2.	Keynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. Itâs perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isnât the issue, just that we do.
3.	I have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to âshake up the systemâ and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?
4.	I have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. 
5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.

Right now my view is hovering between One and Two, but Iâd really like to understand this theory better.
