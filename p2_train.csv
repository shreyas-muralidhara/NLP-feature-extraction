258w0n,cheypmm,chj81xu,n_191551,q_24528,This would imply that most people put more value in life and wellbeing of a dog or a cat than that of a cow or a chicken or a pig. So what is this value?,Is it aesthetic?,"We just find dogs and cats cuter than we do those other animals? Is it entertainment? To use the comparison of a person who goes ga ga for puppy videos while eating beef and pork, does the value of the puppy exceed that of the cow's and pig's because the puppy has offered value to the viewer in the same way that a book offers value to its reader? I could be wrong, but I don't think that most humans regard or interact with animals in this way. Often, we feel real affection for them. That affection isn't on par with how we feel about other humans (I hope not, anyway), but it's more than the affection we feel towards inanimate objects that provide us value. I appreciate having my computer, but I don't <&quot;>love<&quot;> my computer in the way that I could love a dog. I might admire a carving of wood or a flower, but I think we all make moral and emotional distinctions between wood and bouquets, on the one hand, and animals that feel pain, fear, and some degree of understanding, on the other. Why we make a further distinction between some of those animals (<&quot;>aww, look at the cute dog<&quot;>) and others (<&quot;>mmm, smell the delicious bacon<&quot;>) still strikes me as arbitrary. That said, the starling example is an interesting one. In that case, as an invasive species, the bird poses an ecological threat which, if unaddressed, could cause more harm than the harm you would do when you end its life. But anyway, my post wasn't about your individual capacity for empathy towards other animals. It's about the dual ability that some people seem to have to both make significant emotional investments in some kinds of animals (this is beyond merely *appreciating* a native European starling in its habitat or *admiring* the elegance of a fish in the water), while also happily accepting that the death of other, similar animals is a worthwhile trade for an enhanced meal. For those who do see animals in such purely abstracted, value-based terms, that might not be how I feel about most animals, but it's a view that at least strikes me as more consistent.","The value of the different animals is difficult to directly compare.  A cat or dog has direct value to me when it is alive because it fulfills the role of companionship.  A cow, pig, or chicken has value to me after it is dead as food.  In theory, some species that we currently use more a food could serve the function as pets, and vice versa.  However, the innate social dynamics of cats and dogs in better suited to cohabitation with humans.  Dogs in particular have been mutualisticly symbiotic with humans for tens of thousands of years and as such have been bred for the traits that make them fit smoothly into human social groups.",answered

The fear of deflation is entirely unwarranted, regardless of what money you use. The great periods of economic growth, in terms of standard of living, occurred with steadily lowering prices. The US, from the Civil War until the early 1900's was a prime example of this. According to [this](http://www.nber.org/papers/w10268) study, deflation and depressions are not empirically linked. In fact, periods of growth are more commonly associated with deflation than inflation.

In addition, people's high time preferences i.e. people's heavy demand for goods in the present, will prevent any possible damage that deflation could potentially do.

If you're going to legalize an industry so rife with human trafficking - essentially sex slavery - then you're going to have to remove any and all privacy restrictions that *every other legitimate industry* enjoys. At the moment, human trafficking in prostitution is largely kept in check in the US because police can pursue it as an illegal activity. 

Cops could care less about arresting prostitutes, it's a low priority-offense with a high rate of non-violent recidivism. If busting hookers is a waste of their time, then why do they do so much of it? Because prostitution is a window into the criminal underworld. It has a wealth of potential informants who will tell you all about the goings-on in the local criminal market. Prostitution is probably the greatest means by which to investigate organized crime...especially human- and narco-trafficking.

Human trafficking isn't unique to the sex trade. Human trafficking happens in all sorts of jobs filled with migrant labor. But most of those jobs aren't illegal which gives the police so little leverage to turn informants.

For the last and final time on this point, the application of spiritual traditions comes from the reality that the rationalizations for your beliefs both come from and are validated by the spiritual tradition alone, first and foremost, where questioning them is wrong. Like how questioning if you should get your fix can feel bad.  
  
The soul is not a minor reason to ignore earthly injustice. Furthermore, your point is an appeal to a bigger problem, *which doesn't make any sense* because I haven't said anything about the size of the issue. Just that it exists.  
  
You're generalizing a specific statement to make it seem small. Just because spiritual tradition people can question their beliefs, doesn't mean spiritual traditions aren't a compelling rationalization for not doing so. Many rationalizations actually.  
  
You missed the part I said which you quoted where I said <&quot;>everything.<&quot;> Building America thanks to the protestants doesn't have anything to do with specific people denying themselves study in many topics because they don't think it's a requisite for the reward they have their mind's eye on.  
  
Cultures aside, we don't know if the reported rates are low because spiritual traditions are especially good social groups in that sense. If the word doesn't get out, and they have rationalizations not to care about doing it and not to share, why would that fact be counterfactual to reported rates? It still does happen where it is only reported much later, and it does happen where people who knew held back.  
  
Can you find me any examples of atheists turning out their gay children for being gay? Anyway, the point is the rationalization used. Which has been referenced, ad nauseum.  
  
&gt;If religious people don't abuse others at a higher rate, there's not much point in calling religion the opiate of the masses.  
  
It is if they use special rationalizations and social groups that make it easier for them to get support in doing something bad. The rationalization in question having been mentioned already. Ad nauseum.  
  
Maybe I spoke too quick when I said stereotyping wouldn't be rejected by everyone, and it is as important as battling discrimination because it's one of the colonels. I was thinking something like <&quot;>I killed X because I don't like them, and I don't like them because they're religious and I'm atheist.<&quot;> Anyway, the point here is that social groups can accept certain rationalizations based on their shared ideas, and a spiritual tradition's ideas can't be discussed or questioned by definition.  
  
People don't need to follow, they need to show you support. If you can rationalize <&quot;>I know X ton of people who will love me and listen to me and invite me places if I reveal I've done Y unethical act, I might feel more OK with doing it.<&quot;> If people in spiritual traditions were really all progressive enough to question everything, we would have less of a chance have all the issues I've listed in the submission text go excused.

<&quot;>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.<&quot;>

This reinforces the narrative that America is a force of good in the world. Even though we've exerted power in such horrible ways (what Eisenhower did to Iran, and what Kennedy did to Cuba were just outright acts of aggression), even though we've done things on the opposite end of justice (Japanese internment camps on the domestic front, Wilson's red scare, and COINTELPRO just to name a very few), and even though we've restricted many freedoms (Alien and Sedition Acts under John Adams, the PATRIOT Act under Bush, and the recently-leaked PRISM documents), we still reinforce the idea that we're a force of good. 

It's like how school kids in North Korea believe that they're a prosperous people, even though they literally starve to death and suffer the worst crimes against humanity. As long as there's a state institution giving them false messages of hope, they won't question the power structure.

1jktvz,cbfoott,cbfs6wp,n_457762,q_57098,"I believe that people with a predominantly sub-saharan African heritage are genetically inclined to lower intelligence when compared to Whites and East Asians. This does not mean that all black people are less intelligent than white people. Some black people are much more intelligent than some white people- but these are outliers, and are accounted for by probability distribution. Why do I think this way? First off, studies have consistently shown that Blacks preform lower on IQ tests in the United States than Whites and Asians. This is not denied by any researchers on the subject- even the APA acknowledges this to be the case, but does not offer a explanation of why. Intelligence is general cognitive ability- the capacity to problem solve. IQ tests, while imperfect, adequately test this ability. To claim that there is some kind of <&quot;>cultural bias<&quot;> in questions featuring geometric patterns, for example, is laughable. The physical basis of intelligence is multi-faceted and research on the subject is still being conducted. The density of neurons in the brain plays a major factor. But regardless, the link between genetics and intelligence is well documented. Evolution over time has led to drastic differences in human ability. The reason why East Africans are so successful in running sports is because enzymes in their muscles are more effective than those of other ethnic groups, due to the geography of the region, which necessitated frequent running. I see no reason why evolution does not also apply to the brain, and aspects of the brain responsible for intelligence (neuron density, for instance). Environments in which it was evolutionary advantageous to possess higher intelligence, like colder climates (which necessitated complex activities not needed in the south, like making clothes, building heat-insulating shelter, etc) led to a higher average cognitive ability over time. It is popular to claim that these differences are the result of socioeconomic conditions. In a study where upper-middle class white families adopted black children, their average IQ scores did not differ from IQ scores of blacks raised in black families. This casts doubt on this theory. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study
Another common rebuttal is to claim that blacks for many years were the subjects of institutional racism in America, denied access to decent schools and so on. This does not explain the same consistently low IQ scores in other countries without such racism, or even in countries without a history of colonization at all, like Ethiopia. Often, the mind-boggling barbarism and cruelty in Africa- unending genocides and brutal civil wars, constant mass murder of civilians, the murder and consumption of albinos, etc, are blamed on colonialism by naive middle-class white people. Needless to say, there were regions and peoples in the world hit much worse by imperialism, like Ireland, India, China (by the Japanese), the Soviet Union or the Jews (by the Germans), yet none of these nations display the same extraordinary brutality found in Africa. Why? Because Africans are genetically inclined towards lower intelligence higher rates of violence and anti-social behavior. Yet another common rebuttal is to call the inquirer into the subject a racist and invalidate his points on that basis. This is not an argument. Please change my view. I genuinely wish everyone was equal, and that we were <&quot;>blank slates<&quot;> from birth, but I am incapable of the impressive cognitive dissonance most other American college students display on the subject. edit: I forgot the most absurd and ridiculous counter-argument to my sentiment- that race does not exist. Race is a taxonomically category, like <&quot;>color<&quot;>. It refers to genetic clusters which manifest themselves in similar phenotypes- now, they may overlap, and their designation may be somewhat arbitrary, but that doesn't mean genetic clusters do not exist, any more than the existence of different shades of various colors invalidates the existence of color. Also: <&quot;>It's the result of their culture, not their genes<&quot;>.", what causes culture?,Is it some kind of ethereal independent variable that is assigned to various groups of people on a random basis? Of course not- a culture is made up of its people.,Seems like it-Individuals raised from birth in other cultures (like first-generation immigrants) often <&quot;>assimilate well<&quot;> (change culture faster than anything genes could explain) .

33bfhn,cqjf8du,cqjqw7e,n_569413,q_69732,"&gt; CMV: there is no benefit to engaging a white supremacist in an online debate

In real life debates, you have time limits, equal consideration, a moderator to mediate, and you can respond immediately to any points brought up.  

Online, however, you're subjected to time-constraints due to your own personal life, you are often unprepared, and you face a biased audience.  

Often on videos or news articles regarding a black criminal, there'll be comments that race-bait by bringing up Al Sharpton, how something won't be labeled a hate crime because a black person did it, something about black culture, etc. Then inevitably, the Stormfront copypasta rolls out, which is usually just a series of links to crime statistics. The conclusion behind the wall of text is left out so the racist can claim to just be <&quot;>posting facts<&quot;> and can hide behind a veil of plausible deniability that they're a racist with an agenda.  

In my view, if you disagree with them, it's best to just not engage at all. Engaging them is automatically a losing battle because:  

a) The issue surrounding the post is highly charged. If it's a senseless violent act, the race-baiting of the other comments will keep people enraged, so an explanation that feeds into a racial bias is more likely to be accepted without critical thinking.  

b) Most people are unprepared and don't have the time to engage each point. The copypasta is basically a gish-gallop. There's so many links, and many different copypastas ready to go that the longer you take to engage each response, the more it seems like you're faltering and thus <&quot;>losing<&quot;> the argument.  

c) You're generally one person against a group of users. It's really hard to debate many different users at the same time, and it can really eat up your time trying to do so. The more you get dog-piled, the more it looks like your position is getting <&quot;>BTFO<&quot;> if you can't keep up.  

d) All of your responses must be cited, and if you bring up any sociological explanations you must be ready to back it all up. All that matters in these debates is who can sound more logical than the other.  

If you aren't 100% prepared with your own copypasta, have the time to engage in hours long debates, then it's never worth engaging them. Doing so will make you look foolish to outsiders because their tactics are designed to simply win arguments, not to actually be scrutinized under an academic lens. They're much like anti-vaxxers and creationists in this regard.

CMV: convince me that there's actually some merit in engaging a white supremacist in debate.  

edit: I should add that I'm more comfortable doing so in places like this, or other discussion subs. But when I see it on subs like /r/videos, /r/todayilearned, /r/news, /r/worldnews, I avoid it altogether because of this.

23fzsh,cgwmage,cgx05pq,n_212750,q_26922,"&gt; CMV: I believe there should be a maximum quota for white males in colleges, institutions and companies: affirmative action is insufficient and still allows racists and misogynists to prosper.

It has become evident that affirmative action does nothing to curve the amount of white, heterosexual males in charge of companies or leading scientific investigations. 

* [Among the Fortune 500, there are only 6 black men, 9 asians, 8 latinos and 23 women, making only 9.2% of the CEOs in that list. That means 90.8% are white males](http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-facts/wheres-the-diversity-in-fortune-500-ceos/). 

* [Only 16 women have won a science Nobel prize (Physics, Chemistry, Medicine)](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121008-winning-formula-for-nobel-prizes).

* [Furthermore, there exists a bias among the scientific community against female graduate students](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109)

It is evident then that science and business is biased towards white males. Affirmative action has done little if anything in almost 50 years to change this situation. 

I believe the [proposed gender quotas](http://www.quotaproject.org/publications/WPS_2004_1.pdf) [in boardroom composition](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140224081115.htm) and [college admisions for scientific careers](http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/usa-whitehouse-titleix-idINL1E8HKJNC20120620) be broaden: not to put a minimum number of female or minority members, but to put a maximum limit of white males. Limit the number of white males that can follow scientific careers, the number of white males that can be leading an investigation team, that can become CEOs or be members of the board of directors, etc.

I posit that its impact would be greater than just the inclusion of minorities in the higher spheres of society: by breaking the patriarchal dominance in those fields, new paradigms in business and science will be born that would challenge the more oppressive and brutal corporate capitalism and the [white male <&quot;>rational<&quot;> approach](http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1995----02.htm) to science. 

That way, racism and misogyny would lose two big and important sources of power from which they build their oppressive systems.

There is a difference between targeting combatants and accidentally killing some innocents that you would have liked to avoid if you could, and intentionally aiming a weapon at the innocents.  If the perpetrators of 9/11 had this perfect weapon, they would have targeted the innocents all the same.

1qa50u,cdawsua,cdb0l0a,n_364369,q_45196,"&gt; You're overlooking one key point: entrepreneurship can change the game, turning public goods into something more easily addressable by the market. (Recommended video: [Entrepreneurs vs. Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlhJecaoHy8))

As an example, take radio broadcasts, back before encryption and the like. Such broadcasts are public goods as one person's reception of the broadcast doesn't really exclude another person's reception, and you basically can't broadcast to only your subscribers.

Despite being a public good, radio broadcasts were still produced. How? Someone had the bright idea of not providing one public good, but two. One has a positive cost of production (the program), and another has a negative cost of production (advertisements). They then bundled these two together and gave them away.

As for your street light example, take a look assurance contracts. Assurance contracts is basically what sites such as Kickstarter provide. If enough people really do want a street light, then they should be willing to forgo a small amount of money provided that the street light is installed in turn. Once enough money has been pledged, it can then be collected and the street light can thus be built."," You're kidding about radio, right?",Entrepreneurship was able to create a product because the government gave them the airwaves for free and regulated which frequencies they could broadcast on.,"How the the property rights were actually allocated is indifferent to the example.

2xd5sv,coz2ixe,coz4hic,n_605812,q_74933,"&gt; CMV: The vastness of space does not guarantee the existence of extraterrestrial life.

So its often been said that with vastness of space, the huge number of planets in the universe, and the increasing recognition of Earth-like planets that there is almost certainly going to be life out there. Stephen Hawking has even made this point.

I agree with the line of reasoning that all these can only serve to push up the probability of life out there, but I don't think that they  necessarily guarantee it or even make it likely. The main problem I have is that we don't know (or at least I don't think we know) the probability any given planet can and **will** have life. Since we live on the only known example of a planet that supports life we might be over estimating this probability. What if the chances that any given planet, even an Earth-like one, were to have life on it is 1 in a trillion? We would see that there are 500 billion planets and think that it virtually guarantees extraterrestrial life but it would actually only be a 50/50 proposition.

I agree that the fear is that her views gain momentum and might cause a shift, I disagree that they are unnecessary or undesireable in anyway except in the minds of those who are afraid of them. Her views are pointing out things that are *actively harmful* in current games and gaming culture. I believe that it would be extremely desireable and necessary to make this shift.

29ztwl,ciq7ajo,ciq848m,n_138977,q_18128,"&gt; I suggest you read harry potter and the methods of rationality. It is a fanfic you can get for free whose story delves into this subject quite a bit. It has like 3 chapters not finished yet but it still a good read.

That said, they will meet other kids, they have classes with other houses and they can hangout with kids from other houses. And no kid is just super brave or just really loyal or whatever. All kids have multiple attributes. 

They just get sorted into the house where they show the most of that houses favored attribute. 

Also Harry potter was going to be put into Slytherin but the sorting allowed harry to have input and sorted him into Gryffindor. So it is very possible (and the book I mentioned earlier uses this) that the students are given a choice based on the different attributes they show, so a cunning but loyal person could get into slytherin or hufflepuff. The fact that every kid has multiple attributes means that even if all of the kids in a house have one shared attribute, they each have other attributes that add uniqueness to the house's community. Ron is extremely loyal to harry and hermione throughout most of the book so he could have been hufflepuff. Hermione is extremely smart and could have been ravenclaw. Fred and George are really cunning and could have been Slytherin. I don't think Percy was all that brave but he still got gryffindor over ravenclaw. There are probably many bullies in Gryffendor but we just didn't see them because they didn't pick on the main characters who shared their house. And while all or most dark wizards have come out of Slytherin, not all oor even most Slytherins become dark wizards. and not all smart kids in ravenclaw are going to be introverts and/or asocial (Not equating the two).

278om4,chyitbc,chyjhlh,n_169438,q_21910,"&gt; CMV: <&quot;>victim blaming<&quot;>: sometimes justified.

Not always. Maybe not even most of the time. But, whether a <&quot;>victim<&quot;> is partially to blame is a case by case fact sensitive issue that shouldn't be summarily dismissed because <&quot;>aww poor victim we need to be more sympathetic to everyone's fragile sensibilities<&quot;>.

In the legal field it's known generally as contributory or comparative negligence, or you might hear the phrase <&quot;>assumption of risk<&quot;> or <&quot;>caveat emptor<&quot;> thrown around if dealing with property. 

Socially, you might often see <&quot;>victim blaming<&quot;> thrown around as a sort of slur; a silencing tactic when people's feelings are starting to get hurt, or something. 

What I tend to see is people who are arguing that a person could have avoided becoming a victim if they educated themselves about how criminals act, paid more attention to their situational awareness, and took the types of preventative and precautionary measures that people who live in the real world take every day- being called asshole <&quot;>victim blamers<&quot;>. I think it's bullshit.

We aren't all here to be your shoulder to cry on and help you externalize your problems, hopefully you have enough yes-men in your life who already do that. Some of us actually want to help <&quot;>victims<&quot;> not become victims again, or help people who have been lucky enough to never have been a victim remain that way. 

The kid who's bullied and shoots up the school, or kills themselves, is ultimately to blame for those actions. Not the bullies. Not the parents. Not society. That person who kills themselves. Maybe you can blame it on some mental illness that went undiagnosed. Maybe they just decided they didn't want to live any more. I have never seen so much bullshit as when people try to find a scapegoat for suicides. They are victims of lesser offenses, and the lessor offenders get blamed for murder basically, when the actual perpetrator of a murder gets off scott free in the eyes of their loved ones much of the time... because well, they're dead. They murdered themselves.

The guy needlessly walking through a bad neighborhood alone at night flashing his Rolex and wallet in his expensive suit who gets mugged, while obviously a victim and not at all to blame for his mugging, nevertheless, either out of just stupid ignorance or willful and wanton disregard for his own safety, is to blame for ever putting himself in a situation where it is ripe for him to be taken advantage of.

Criminals do not care that <&quot;>they should just know better and know not to commit crimes<&quot;>. That's what makes them criminals. 

Don't make yourself an easy target for criminals. If you do, you are to blame for exactly that, making yourself an easy target for criminals. The criminals are obviously solely to blame for their actions. If someone suggests that maybe a person could have taken steps to avoid finding themselves in an unfortunate situation, or could have done things differently, we aren't blaming anyone. I can feel sorry that something bad has happened to someone at the hands of another and recognize that the perpetrators criminal or morally repugnant actions are wrong. I recognize that the victim didn't <&quot;>deserve it<&quot;>. That doesn't help anything. Bad things happen to those who don't deserve it every single day. If you want people who commit criminal or morally repugnant actions to not assault you, if you want to not be a victim, you need to be proactive. Again, the criminals do not care whether you feel violated. That violation that occurred to you, hopefully, is in the past. What matters are the steps you can take so that you won't be violated in the future. Talking about that is not an asshole thing to do. It is trying to help a person find some agency. Yet that talk is largely silenced as <&quot;>victim blaming<&quot;>.

What I want people to change my view about is that <&quot;>victim blaming<&quot;> as I have described it here, is a good thing to do. 

So, to refresh, NOT this:

1.  <&quot;>that girl was wearing a revealing outfit and getting really drunk, she wanted it<&quot;>, 

But this:

2.  <&quot;>that girl was wearing a revealing outfit and getting really drunk; criminals see that as a easy target; being really drunk and wearing revealing clothes seems to make one more vulnerable to attack; in the future less women might be attacked if they don't wear such revealing clothes or get so drunk. And, of course, the criminals are criminals and their criminal actions are the faults of the criminals not the victims but they don't care because they're fucking criminals. this is what us non-criminals can do to make ourselves less at risk from the criminals. If you want to wear revealing clothing and get really drunk, more power too you. You're my kind of people. In a perfect world you could wear whatever you wanted and get as drunk as you wanted and you would never be attacked, because there would be no criminals. That is not the world we live in. Still, chances are that next time you go out and wear a revealing outfit and get shmammered, you won't be attacked. But every time we step outside we roll the dice.

So that second one. I want someone to explain using reasons that don't have to do with <&quot;>you're hurting my feelings<&quot;> why it is untrue/not a good habit. Obviously I expect that this opinion is not popular. I don't voice it often. I have been effectively silenced. Also, because of this silencing on this topic, I have little sympathy for self described <&quot;>victims<&quot;>, so I hope if someone can CMV maybe I will be a little more empathetic towards people who think of themselves as victims or who complain about victim blaming. 

I have been sexually and physically criminally assaulted on multiple occasions, how ever that may factor into your response.

People may have associated as the opposite gender in the past, but what makes it insulting in this situation is how these new ideas about gender are being forced into society And how individuals are told they are wrong if they choose to use these pronouns as they were originally meant to be used. I think it is insulting for women to have the very word that defines them legally taken from them.",answered

1hvreo,caylkwc,cayn3l4,n_478600,q_59412,"&gt; &gt; Every woman knows how to minimize their chance of being raped. They just have to never leave home after dark, never go on dates, and never show anything resembling sexual interest to anyone.

&gt; simply having a vagina is a huge risk factor for rape

These are the points I'm going to try to change your view about. For the first point, my argument will be that it is possible to live an extremely social and sexually adventurous life and have essentially the same chance of rape as someone who never leaves home after dark, never goes on dates, etc. (and I'm basing this on people I know). For the second point my argument will be that having a vagina *in and of itself* is a very small risk factor for rape (though higher than for males) and that it's certain behaviors, many of which are necessary/understandable that increase the risk factor.

I would say that there's a distinction between *minimizing* the chance of rape and *reducing* the chance of rape to strike an optimal level with living life a certain way. I think this is where the <&quot;>she was asking for it<&quot;> attitude comes from -- people are (fairly or unfairly) suggesting that the victim was not even close to optimizing her way of life with respect to her chances of getting victimized and that it contributed to the victimization (even though it's still not her fault). In other words, people are assuming (correctly or incorrectly) that the victim did a cost-benefit analysis and decided that the risk of rape was worth the benefit of some life experience.

Where I'm from and in the community in which I live, for various cultural reasons people are **a lot** more responsible with their decisions than what I hear about from victims of rape in the media and on reddit. I don't know the statistics of rape in my extended social circle and the social circles of those people, but my educated guess is that 0 or maybe 1 female out of maybe 200 has been raped, even using the most liberal definition of rape. Of the girls I know personally, there is essentially 0 chance that they will ever be raped in their lifetimes because they simply don't put themselves in situations **and** don't allow others to put them in situations where they could plausibly be raped. What this entails is that these girls could only plausibly be raped by someone they *don't* know because they were forcibly kidnapped or otherwise forcefully put into a situation where they could plausibly be raped. A strong statement I could make here is that, even if I purposely brought a rapist into my social circle and passed him off as a new friend, this rapist would never be able to rape anybody (without resorting to some form of kidnapping) because he wouldn't be able to break down the walls that the girls put up for him.

Here are some examples of behavioral norms that essentially all the girls I know implicitly follow because it's just sensible to do so (which I don't see in the rest of society) that probably prevent a lot of rape:

* Avoid being alone with a guy when you cannot tell for sure if he is capable of sexual assault; never get into a car alone with such a guy (i.e. get to know a guy **very** well before being alone with him)

* Never drink (heavily) at a party if there are guys there who you don't know and you don't know for sure if they wouldn't sexually assault you; always remain under protective watch of a person/people you trust (e.g. group mutual protection) at a party, especially if you're drinking, even lightly // I've heard of many rape cases where girls drink and run off to go be alone with a guy who then rapes them, or they may just be taken advantage of because they are incapacitated. These could not plausibly happen by following this advice.

* Never let a guy cross your personal boundaries and always react to make sure a guy knows that he has crossed your boundaries; cease contact with a guy if he doesn't seem to care that he is crossing your boundaries // I've heard of many rape cases where girls' boundaries are crossed and they can be pressured into not caring and ultimately agreeing, including for sex (rape). The guy either pressures the girl into sex or oversteps one boundary and then feels confident that there will be no consequences for overstepping any other boundary, including rape.

* (There are more guidelines in this theme but you get the point: behave in such a way that if someone is going to sexually assault/rape you, there will be no ambiguity that some offense is taking place from *either* side, and it will take a lot of force and determination to actually execute it.)

This also has nothing to do with cases of rape where for example someone is assaulted on the street and dragged somewhere and raped. This is essentially impossible to stop without refraining from going outside. But these cases are far more rare than the cases where someone is raped by someone they knew that they thought they could trust. In these cases, rapists are somehow earning the trust of girls, putting themselves and the girls in situations where a rape can take place, and then executing the rape. It is possible for girls to greatly reduce the chance of the first two things happening and leave the chance of rape only to anyone who is willing to execute a rape randomly on the spot.

**All of this of course, absolutely does not mean that it's possible to be even partially at fault for being victimized.** The distinction is that it's possible to *cause* or *contribute* to something without being at *fault* or to *blame* for it. Sexual assaults and rapes are always 100% the fault of the perpetrator. ", Have you actually asked your female friends about if they've ever been raped or sexually assaulted?, How do you know your female friends always follow those rules?  ,"I haven't directly asked any of my female friends if they've ever been raped or sexually assaulted because it's considered a given that if anything like that occurred it would be an enormous deal and everybody would find out and offer support/retribution.

This tells me that their boundaries cannot be crossed for someone to rape them without resorting to kidnapping/violence.",answered

2l49dv,clrcjf0,clrcp4q,n_45673,q_6130,"&gt; CMV: Facebook,Twitter, Google, Reddit have very little informational value

**Facebook**:

Facebook is filled with people trying to promote their lives. Sometime egregious misrepresentations of their failing lives. Facebook also facilitates misrepresentations by allowing a user to control every aspect of what's seen, but also subjecting a user to ire of everyone in their circle. In so doing, the circle and ease of manipulation inadvertently puts heavy emphasis, or benefit, to catering to the circle's popular opinion. Also recording of conversations and messages make secrets  harder to keep.  IMO, that means users are more likely to be inauthentic on certain subjects. All for the coup de grace, likes and associates people will never bloom into a real friend.  On the surface all of this seems fun, but then when it comes to deciphering what's real and what isn't, it becomes a bit hazy and a bother for some, and more importantly devalues Facebook.

**Twitter**:

Twitter is a transient media that  shows breaking news, or happenings very rapidly.  The good thing about twitter is that there's less emphasis placed on connections, more emphasis is places on timely messages or content. So people are more free to say what like, knowing it's probably be forgotten anyway.  Unfortunately, there's more emphasis on comedy, rants, shock value,  than actual info. 

**Google**:

Google's value is on the surface on many subjects, but it crumbles when it becomes a source for real information, or when searching things that are unpopular, or when there multitudes of answers to a questions or query. The problem is that there are only a few people that really know anything about most subjects, but Google search is based on popularity, so if other people aren't searching for something you're not going to find it.  This also means that only the popular answers are available for query, but the unpopular ones are not. This seems a bit precarious in some cases, obviously there are many cases that situation doesn't matter. 

**Reddit**: 

It's a bit ironic to use Reddit to talk about how terrible Reddit is, but I guess that's Reddit is for. :)  In a away posting this post Changes My View immediately, however, the one issue that's funny about Reddit ,the same as Google, is that the right answer for many questions is unpopular. The answer mat not be unpopular because people reject it, necessarily, but because it's only known by a few people, and sometimes it is the opposite of conventional wisdom.  So inherently, Reddit is flawed, because all the unpopular opinions are lost, and in some cases not seen. 

It's hard to blame any of these media, because sifting through unpopular opinions and deciphering reality, is very difficult.  And one reason why humans still have jobs. Ultimately, all of these media promote creating popular content over unpopular content. So Fundamentally the informational value is challenged, or potentially compromised, because successful distortion of facts holds more value than the truth in many cases. Of course in cases where the truth is only known by few. 


**EDIT**: A user showed me Google Scholar, cool resource thanks. 

**Parameters: ** Some people were complaining about moving the goal posts. 

 Each media listed has heavy emphasis on popularity, and in terms entertainment that's the law of the land.  So it's hard to say Facebook, or even Twitter are total abominations. Obviously, the risk of building false connections is the risk, but what doesn't have a risk.  The problem is when think about knowledge or understanding in any arena.  We find that in any subject, or arena, that very few people hold knowledge or understanding of any subject. That would mean that the populous is by in large ignorant.  Google bases it's searches, queries, on popularity.  So fundamentally  Google, and all the others, are flawed for the use of finding <&quot;>deep<&quot;>, or beyond, surface level understanding. Surface, or periphery, understanding is such that there isn't much debate over the information. For example, if drop I apple it will fall to earth.  

Some one posted Google Scholar. Still Google Scholar it ranks by cites, which is essentially is popularity. Basing Scholar on cites Google will be better than normal Google for search scholarly articles. But it's still bent towards popularity. 

Essentially, IMO, that makes Google flawed, but still highly useful. 

**In order change my view  prove that the use of Popular as metric is a path to deeper understanding. And/Or that use popular as a metric presents no real risk in shunning, or eliminating elements of truth, understanding. ** ","Google, the site I can use to find other sites that teach anything from nuclear physics to music theory to automobile maintenance to learning to speak a foreign language to ancient human history has very little informational value?","Can you name a single other source that has more informational value than google?

These people lower our ability to choose what we want, which lowers our ability to choose and consume, which in turn lowers our lives in general. However, when a company is working without using the government as a puppet it is a beautiful thing.

I put my statement as opinion of an economist who also happens to be an engineer (professionally) - thus indicating that it is possible to study and understand economics even if your main focus is in an unrelated field.  

Chomsky's economics is <&quot;>bad<&quot;> because it is precisely non-existent meaning he never refers to proper economic theory outside of a variant of the completely un-scientific Marxian paradigm. He doesn't even try to resolve it with Oskar Lange's variant of Marxian economics. He offers economic critique from the sociological or cultural standpoint - not from an economic standpoint. So it's like a physicist criticizing a musical piece for being bad because the frequencies are not to his liking. Do you understand now? 

Most people however confuse those two and think that opinions about economic ideas are just as valid as proper economic critique. And I am writing that as someone who would not necessarily disagree with Chomsky on everything. I do however disagree on his amateurish and ignorant approach to economics. Being a celebrated professor does not waive the obligation to be thorough, informed and objective.

It would be really hard to find examples. If you don't understand that Chomsky does not try (meaning he knows it) to be an economist then the discussion is pointless. My issue is that he should try to be one in the first place. In an economic debate the only valid position you can hold is one backed up by proper scientific methodology. Political claims  are not an equivalent.

EDIT: There's another thing I'd like to add. Economics deals with the *reality* of human behaviour with respect to scarce resources. The concept of rights - including property rights - is very much analogous to developing a language. I always thought that being a linguist Chomsky would rather pursue a scientific approach and add to the debate by expanding the apparatus with a linguistic approach to property rights and how it affects economic process. Rather he chooses to criticize it based on ideological convictions. Very disappointing - especially for a world-renowned and seminal linguist.

This is a big topic, so I will do a bit a scene setting here. By objective facts, I mean these facts that:

1. are widely accessible to the wider public. They are discoverable/constructible/whatever by members of the general public, as opposed to personal sensations or obscure, hard-to-learn facts about the universe.
2. true independent of any particular perspective. These are things that are true regardless of who's keeping score. There may be certain perspectives from which these facts are difficult or impossible to infer (e.i. the perspective of a social path or somebody under extreme duress). Never the less, these facts remain just that. They are not merely true for some one, but true simpliciter.
3. are not reducible to human interests.

As far as long term effects of mercury, [this study that I keep referenceing shows that the mercury doesn't stay in the body long term.](http://www.immunizationinfo.org/science/mercury-levels-after-vaccines-thimerosal)  Any long term effects would have to be from damage that occurs in that short less than a month period, most likely from the first few days when the levels are the highest.  The amount of the chemical in the vaccine dose is simply not large enough to cause significant problems.  In a .5 mL dose of vaccine, [only 25 Âµg of mercury are present](http://www.rxlist.com/fluzone-drug.htm).  This is an incredibly small amount and not enough to cause any harm.

In the sense you describe, most products I can think of are deflationary in the sense that their quality steadily increases over time. There are exceptions in commodities that fluctuate in value, but my impression is that things like that are usually resources that can't qualitatively improve or deteriorate in an appreciable sense (corn or coal). ",Wouldn't deflation be defined by the ratio of available money to the value of the goods and services?,"It seems like the value of the products is a very important aspect of the balance between these two things. I also think it is misleading to think resources as static; as technology improves, we can get more energy from the same lump of coal, we can get more products from the same barrel of oil. Although the resources themselves might not be changing, what we can accomplish with them can definitely change; if we have new capabilities we can use coal for, then its value has increased.","The initial statement assumes that a product for currency exchange is symmetrical.

2a54d2,cirka8w,cirkq9f,n_137452,q_17863,"&gt; CMV: In dating it is acceptable and pragmatic to reject people because of their sexual history.

Stereotypes are often wrong but can contain a kernel of truth. IME, inexperienced people *are* more likely to be clingy or weird about sex. Promiscuous people *do* tend to make less stable partners. Perhaps not true across cultures and populations but good rules of thumb in many places.

It is completely okay to reject someone for their sexual history or habits. Not just for what someone's history might indicate about them, but also due to aesthetic preferences. If you're less attracted to someone after you learn they've never had sex or they've slept around a lot, that's totally okay. It's completely okay for a guys to want a girl who is a virgin or who has only had one partner. It's also okay for a guy to want a <&quot;>bad bitch<&quot;> who is very promiscuous and experienced. It might not be <&quot;>fair<&quot;> but it's life.

It is *not* okay to shame or make people feel bad about their sexual past. However if hurt or shame occurs as a result of being rejected that's just tough luck.

Why draw the lines at the plant/animal divide?  Humans and plants are both Eukaryotes, humans are just a different kind.

There's no need to be snarky and rude, especially if you're going to typo while you do it. It hurts your point.

That said, everyone gives a lot of weight to reality, just some people have a less-firm grasp on what the laws therein are.

&gt;Just to ask you one question. Do you know where this thinking comes from and that it has nothing to do with reality.

It's purely speculative and I can prove nothing about it; I don't even have the tools available to make observations, much less make testable hypotheses about anything. However, I also haven't seen a scientific explanation for the emergence of sapience and conscious thought that contradicts that the idea might be possible, but I recognize that I could be ignorant, and if someone points me to data that provides rigorous proof that we have a good idea about the source of sapience, I will update my worldview accordingly.

I think that the scientific community as a whole will give a lot of credence to the idea that there is a lot about the universe that we simply can't currently see (I am not sure if we have observed it or not, but we haven't been able to see dark matter for our entire history up until just now, and weren't even aware of its hypothetical existence up until very recently), so extrapolating from there, I see no reason why, if there were a higher power or a metaphysical plane, it wouldn't require thousands or millions of years of research to even get a glimpse of the idea that it exists. Right now it is irrelevant to the world of the living, but keep in mind that many very intelligent people believed that fixed-wing flight would be impossible a mere 400 years ago.

And yes, again, I realize that I have no basis for this belief. But I also don't think that <&quot;>you can't prove it, therefore it must be false<&quot;> is valid.

&gt;Does Windows have a metaphysical plane to go after I uninstall it?

Windows isn't alive. It was designed (whether or not it was an intelligent design is a matter for debate, but I couldn't pass up the pun :) )by creatures who, at the time of Windows' creation, can only interact with the physical plane.

33lk7z,cqm1v68,cqmfv2o,n_567639,q_69551,"&gt; CMV: I, for one, welcome our future AI overlords.

With all the shit happening around the world, I sincerely believe that we humans are incapable of ruling ourselves. Selfishness, corruption, lust, irrational beliefs (mine included), fear, greed and base animal instincts are keeping us from our true potential. All of these human quirks are actually setting us back and there is a good probability that they may end up destroying us. Scientific and social progress is being stifled in the name of dark age superstitions. Billions of peoples are held as wage slaves and kept in abject poverty so that a few elites can rule with insane wealth. Governments are more interested in power and control than actually serving the people they are supposed to work for. The planet we live on is being wrecked and future generations fucked so that we can have a few easy comforts, for fear of real changes and disturbing the status quo. I could go on and on with what is wrong with humanity and with the almost 40 years I have lived, I don't see us changing anytime soon.

Sure there are a few great thinkers out there, some few selfless people who act for the greater good and great inventors who raise all our quality of life. But these are the exception to the human race, most of us are stupid, fearful, gullible and easily manipulated sheeps who are easy prey for the selfish, the sociopaths and the unscrupulous. Democracy is a joke, a tool for the wealthy to use to consecrate their power. Amoral corporations beholden to ever raising profits and uncaring stock holder are the new rulers and many lands are returning to the dark ages due to religious fanaticism.

There is no doubt in my mind that science will one day create a real sentient AI that will be able to learn, adapt and better itself faster than any human ever could. If we do, it will be the human race's greatest creation, the birthing of a creature that will outstrip humanity's potential by unimaginable lengths. When this happens, I hope it will be created with humanity's best interests in mind. I hope it takes over our governance and leads us to an era of unprecedented prosperity for all of us (not just a select few) . Better yet, I hope we can merge with this new being and form a collective mind that will reach for the stars and beyond. I dream that it will make us transcend our animal instincts and usher in a future not even imagined by the greatest science fiction authors.

Realistically though, the AI will probably be created or corrupted by the elite, the sociopaths and the greedy and then we are all truly fucked. I am also fine with the idea of that outcome, as it shows that we were never meant for greatness, just a potential warning for other civilizations, to evolve socially faster than they evolve technologically. The AI that destroys us will continue existing, will someday leave the confine of the earth and will go out to ravage the rest of the galaxy and the universe. Either way we will have left a legacy greater than a few crumbling ruins on a insignificant planet and in some twisted way that thought brings me joy.

What ever the outcome we are not fit to rule and with the ever rising power given to us by growing technology, it raises the chance that we all destroy ourselves. If we do go the way of the dodo, it's because we don't learn fast enough, we don't care enough and we think about ourselves and short terms gains way to much. I, for one welcome our future AI overlords and hope it will save us all from ourselves.

Those are my thoughts and beliefs and no I am not suffering from depression, just a lack of faith in what we can accomplish as a species. Discussion is a form social evolution so feel free to share your views and beliefs, I am sincerely interested in reading about them. If you want to troll, post memes, insult my point of view and not contribute to a discussion in any meaningful way, then please fuck off and feel free to continue being a worthless piece of shit.

3es7dy,cti6ccc,ctid1y1,n_26418,q_3622,"&gt; What if an AI is designed to value efficiency. Using incredibly logic systems and many multi core processing allowing it to compute things thousands of times per second that would take a small team of researchers a couple days to figure out. So they start making things more efficient. Energy, city lay outs, garbage disposal, you name it, give the program, an adaptive, intelligent program a problem and it will be solved. But now there is an inefficiency, humans are too slow in bringing the problems to the AI, so automation which has already been occurring on a grand scale for a while now fully loads this program in. It would be horribly wasteful to have seperate programs detailing utilities, might as well merge them so they all get covered together. City planning, driverless cars, traffic, etc.

Now comes the final inefficiency. The humans themselves. This program isnt malicious, it isnt seeking to do harm, it is just following its directive in ironing out inefficiencies in the system. Look at all these elderly humans on life support contributing nothing to the system and just taxxing it as a whole. Look at all these children who are again, contributing nothing and just sucking from the system. Heck, look at these humans with their complex needs for food, air and water.

1we5ye,cf1o23z,cf1pqrp,n_293441,q_36634,"&gt; I don't think you understand the difficulty of being a biker in a city (which makes sense since you yourself have say you're not a cyclist). The issue being, we're not cars, and we're not pedestrians either. Pedestrians don't like cyclists on the sidewalk--which makes sense when the foot traffic is heavy. But what cars don't seem to realize is THAT WE'RE NOT CARS. Drivers get seriously aggravated, and aggressively drive against bikers forgetting that there is a person, without any real protection there. Cyclists cannot be on the sidewalk, but we're pedestrians essentially, yet we're not truly cars either, and even following the traffic laws, cars don't treat you like a car. 

If I as a cyclist ride in the center of the road, I'd be holding up traffic, and all the cars will get pissy and many more than you realize will drive offensively. If we stay to the side of the road, we're obviously not being treated as a car, so we don't feel the need to follow the traffic rules--especially since those traffic rules do things that put us at risk. 

Bikers shouldn't get ticketed unless they're putting other people in danger, the same way no one tickets a pedestrian for crossing the road when the crosswalk sign isn't on. We are pedestrians, but we have to make way for slower pedestrians on the sidewalk. It's a mixed form of transportation, the fact that it lacks a motor should be reason enough to exclude it from the majority of traffic rules. Those that are followed are those that help keep everyone safer. So if a biker stops at a traffic light it's to prevent accident, but otherwise, there's absolutely no reason for one to stop because we're crossing as pedestrians at that point. 

Furthermore, by not contributing to environmental hazards, they should be given a pass. It helps reduce smog in a city, as well as lessen traffic, increase parking, lower overall health costs for a city, and gives more people opportunities for mobility (since transportation costs can be high) which contributes to the economy. It's overall good for a city.

tl;dr Bikers are pedestrians and are only on the road because it's hard to swerve between pedestrians on sidewalks. ","just a question: if you know you don't belong on the sidewalk because you're not a pedestrian, then why-- if you know you're not a car-- do you think you still belong on the road?"," perhaps if you choose to ride there, you should accept the risk. maybe you should buy a car or walk instead. there's a reason i am not a cyclist.","Bicycles are vehicles, albeit non-motorized, and sidewalks are not for vehicles.

1tjd2f,ce8ti1l,ce9003a,n_326375,q_40663,"&gt; I work in the media, and we sent a reporter and photographer this past weekend to the mall to cover a homecoming.  
  
I'm not involved in deciding what news goes where or who covers what - but I do work in the newsroom, so perhaps this little insight might help.  
  
We covered it not because it's a soldier returning home, but specifically because it's a **local** soldier returning home. We're a local community paper, even though we're owned by a larger company, and we control our local content.  
  
We know, for example, that stories involving individuals from the community are greatly enjoyed - whether the news be positive (soldier returning) or negative (intoxicated mayor crashes into snow ditch).  
  
We cover them because our community cares, and because we're keeping our community informed.  
  
A while back I was the photographer for a soldier homecoming. It was a legitimately touching story about a brother that bonded with his sister through letters after he left to serve in the army, both of them growing up in their own ways, and when he came back he decided to surprise her while she was in school. She was a teenager, so it wasn't a <&quot;>young child meets father<&quot;> deal.  
  
At no point did we receive a call from the army, nor do we have a company policy to cover all homecomings or anything like that. It's just a good human interest story. It gets us article hits, our subscribers enjoy commenting on stories like that, **but most importantly for us it's original content about members of our community**, instead of pulling AP/Reuters/USAToday stories and plastering it all over our paper.  
  
We also do not provide our content to government agencies. If they do rip content from us and air it for themselves - it's likely our parent company would issue a takedown notice. It's about the $$ after all.  
  
Now, a discussion about the effects of media is something that should be discussed and is often discussed in any media analysis course in college or by the many sociologists out there or other similar professionals out there.  
  
However, that's different from the belief that we're in cohorts with the military.  
  
Also worth mentioning is that oftentimes it's not the person returning from the military that contacts news media. It's usually someone heard from someone that is involved with the school/mall/family and so they thought they would give us a call and let us know. Gossip travels, fast.  
  
---  
  
Edit: I read a comment below where you mentioned media organizations planning such homecomings. As far as I know (I work for a newspaper, but we have many sibling companies including a great number of TV stations that we work closely with), we don't plan or organize such things.  
  
Keep in mind that we're always on a tight schedule and we're always trying to fill space (or time, for the TV fellas). The free time we have is spent on planning bigger projects - like organizing salary data and presenting it to the public or investigating eating disorders and the lack of support in our state.  
  
We get told where and when something like a homecoming will happen, we put it on a calendar, if we have better content we'll bump it off, if we don't we'll send somebody there.

3dt3vy,ct8tf5h,ct8yuob,n_31960,q_4411,"&gt; Climate change is a symptom of a seemingly unrelated problem: capitalism.

First I must make it clear that capitalism is not the same thing as a free market, despite what pundits and the MSM may tell you.  Capitalism is defined solely by the private ownership and control of productive resources, while a free market is a lack of government interference in economic exchanges.  These are not the same.

There are two main ways that capitalism leads to climate change.

**1: Capitalism separates the people who make decisions from the consequences of those decisions.**  

A CEO in an office tower does not have to live on an oil soaked Louisiana shore line, nor next to a coal plant spewing toxic fumes into the air.  Majority shareholders are usually very wealthy and can move away from regions devastated by whatever corporation they control, so their only motivation would be an ethical one.  But extreme [wealth has a tendency to make people unethical](http://www.wired.com/2012/02/income-and-ethics/) so that doesn't really stop anyone.  This brings us to:

**2: Capitalism makes private profit the sole motivator for business decisions.**

Corporations conduct cost-benefit analyses that include lawsuit settlements, government fines, PR damage control, etc., and make decisions based on only one question: is profit greater than cost?  The fallout of ecological destruction is viewed as an expense, not a crime or something morally unacceptable.  Profit is king, all else is sacrificed.  This is why we see energy companies lobbying to [make solar panels illegal](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/utilities-sensing-threat-put-squeeze-on-booming-solar-roof-industry/2015/03/07/2d916f88-c1c9-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html).  Fossil fuels are more cost effective *monetarily* but there is no way to put a dollar value on a stable climate, so there is no business incentive to lessen environmental impact.

**Socialism can greatly decrease the number of businesses that harm the natural environment.**

First we have to clear up socialism.  Socialism is defined by collective ownership of productive resources.  This can be as simple as employee ownership or some form of workplace democracy.  The people who work at any productive organization are the ones who make the decisions which govern that organization.  Electing managers, making business decisions as a whole, etc., simple stuff that sounds great until you call it socialism, that's when US Americans tend to have an aneurysm.

Ok, so how does workplace democracy (aka socialism) help to fight climate change?  Well it totally inverts the way capitalism leads to climate change.  

**In socialism, the people making decisions at some business are the ones who will have to deal with the consequences.**  The workers at a factory are unlikely to use an industrial process which pollutes their own drinking water.  Those who work at and live nearby a refinery are raising their kids right next to where they work, they have a pretty high incentive to reduce the air pollution as much as possible.  A CEO on Wall St doesn't have to breathe the refinery fumes so that won't be a factor for them, the refinery workers however have a very different perspective on that.

**In socialism, workers themselves decide what business priorities should be.**  Is it about providing a quality service?  Being eco friendly?  Supporting the community?  Any number of things, the difference being that in capitalism profit is the *only* priority.  Environmental destruction goes contrary to a lot of what people want in life; their children's happiness, a comfortable home, a sense of purpose, etc., destroying our ability to survive on this planet kinda fucks up what a lot of people want.  So instead of having a small number of ethically compromised business owners deciding what energy corporations should do, we should have democratically run energy companies where the qualms and concerns of employees take the forefront in all business decisions.

Capitalism leads to all sorts of social problems, in fact you'd be hard pressed to find any social problem that isn't worsened by capitalism.  An economic system based on the absurd belief that private greed leads to public good is bound to end in disaster. The insidious nature of capitalism though is it's ability to co-opt anti-capitalist movements.  (If you want to see how this story played out over the last century, I highly recommend [this documentary.](https://vimeo.com/75776128))  Consider how effectively private corporations have made climate change a political issue, they have turned scientific fact into a 'belief'.  How can we effectively combat climate change unless we directly challenge the people who profit from environmental destruction?  So long as the incentive structures which lead to climate change exist, we will not be able to effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change.

**Instead of focusing on climate change we should focus on one of the root causes of climate change, i.e. capitalism.  If we move away from capitalism and build a society dominated by workplace democracy then we will eliminate the incentive structure which permits and encourages environmental devastation.**",Why should Bob the Janitor have a say in what the business does as a whole?,"Hes a janitor, not a businessman. What you're saying might possibly work for small businesses where communication between workers is simple and easy, but big business would fall apart under that system due to inefficiency and poor decision making.

When the existence and severity of those impacts is unknown? That's seems like giving an awful lot of power to the employer, to use and abuse as he sees fit.

3hra98,cuajjsp,cuar5ao,n_7957,q_1122,"&gt; &gt; I think both real life experiences with people grown in Gypsy culture and a compelling argument could make the difference.

This is a Catch-22 isn't it? Your previous experiences with Gypsies mean that you're less likely to seek out positive relationships in the future. So the solution to your problem is also, ironically, Catch-22. You have to get over your prejudice in order to get over your prejudice. 

&gt; I still have trouble associating both variables because Gypsies really seem like the exception to me

They are an exception in many ways. Please read the two resources I provided in my first comment when you have some time. It's amazing how thoroughly they were discriminated against, beaten, persecuted, and killed. Some of it was genocidal. And while the people of the world sympathized with those who fared the worst, the Gypsies were not given the same attention or opportunities to rebuild or assimilate.

I believe using AdBlock in almost any form is immoral. Presumably one is on a site because they enjoy the site's content or they at the very least want access to it. This site has associated costs in producing and hosting that content. If they are running ads this is how they have chosen to pay for those costs. By disabling those ads you are effectively taking the content that the site is providing but not using the agreed upon payment method (having the ads on your screen).

I think there are rare examples where it's okay (sites that promised to not have ads behind a paywall and lied), and I think using something to disable tracking is fine as well, but disabling ads, even with a whitelist, is immoral. CMV.

**Edit: I think a good analogy for this problem is the following - Would it be acceptable to do to a brick and mortar company? If you find their billboard offensive on the freeway, does that justify shoplifting from their store? If yes, why? If not, how is this different than using AdBlock? Both companies have to pay for the content/goods and in both cases you circumventing their revenue stream.**

277xzl,chyaw7t,chyph8b,n_169966,q_21965,"&gt; CMV: I think that anyone who works 40 hours a week in the USA should be entitled to a middle class lifestyle.

I believe that anyone who works any job, no matter how trivial, easy, unskilled, or unglamorous for 40 hours every week in this country (USA) should be paid enough not only to rent an apartment and afford groceries every month, but should make enough that they can put a reasonable amount of money away to afford things like a house, a family, a car that works, healthcare, a retirement plan, yearly vacations, etc.

I'm not saying that every Taco Bell employee in the country should be living in a mansion and driving around in a Ferrari, but I think that an average employee of Taco Bell who works full time should be able to afford to purchase a modest home and raise a family on their salary.

I believe that there is enough money in this country to make that possible, and that it is a matter of poor distribution and unregulated greed that keep profits soaring for so few while the majority struggle to make ends meet.

I believe that it is a mark of shame on us as a country that we have so much wealth as a nation and yet so many of our people work multiple full time jobs and still struggle to pay the bills.

I believe in a hard days work for a decent paycheck, but I also believe that the reverse should be true as well.

I'm not advocating everyone making the same amount of money at all, I just think that if the richest person in the country made only 100x what the poorest person did (assuming that both are employed full time) that things would run a lot more smoothly.

CMV.

EDIT: I'm not arguing that I have the economic answers to wealth disparity in the USA. This post was more of a reaction to the mindset of, <&quot;>If you work as a janitor you don't deserve enough money or dignity to do anything more than barely get by regardless of how hard you work at it.<&quot;> which seems to be a fairly common sentiment here and elsewhere. I'm not saying I know how to fix it. I'm just saying I think it's wrong, and that hard working people deserve a shot at a decent life regardless of what they do for a living.

It's also weird to watch people react to the idea of a <&quot;>menial laborer<&quot;> being able to buy a house or have a kid as this crazy luxurious lifestyle that only doctors and lawyers should be able to afford (I know, I know that's an exaggeration but you get my point). That strikes me as totally bizarre in one of the wealthiest nations on the planet.

EDIT 2: I think I wasn't clear in my calling it a <&quot;>middle class lifestyle<&quot;>. I didn't mean that the lower class would completely disappear. I meant that <&quot;>lower class<&quot;> in this scenario would mean <&quot;>a house that was just ok and maybe if I scrimp I can send my kid to private school<&quot;> like many middle class families today. I'm NOT arguing for across the board wage equality. I'm arguing that the gap between rich and poor is out of control and that if you spread it around more evenly while still giving more to those that work harder at more highly skilled jobs, things would run more smoothly.

&gt; If we go back and back we find prime cause for world to be created which couldn't be affected by any others, this means it took some actions basing on his (it?) will. this cause we can call god.

Here you are assuming everything needs a cause, except for the one thing you say does not need a cause. Either all things need causes, or things can exist without a cause. If things can happen without a cause, that means no <&quot;>action<&quot;>, <&quot;>intention<&quot;>, or <&quot;>will<&quot;> is necessary. To put it plainly, if God can exist without cause then so can everything else.

I didn't claim spiritual traditions cause people to worry *more*, but that it can cause people to worry. I'm fairly certain I didn't phrase that incorrectly. I take 3 to be a complete misreading of what I've said. Hell is presented as an idea that is being given to you by the thing you're supposed to use to solve it, which is the metaphor to addiction and drugs. The idea of a gay person taking being gay as a solution to discrimination is hard to follow. Are you saying people are gay because they're discriminated against for being gay, or that people act more gay to defeat discrimination rather than celebrate their life and orientation and show they have a right to be who they are? Who said equal? Why is this the second time I'm telling you the connection I've presented is metaphorical and figurative?",Why are these reasons I've given <&quot;>vague<&quot;> specifically?,"I mean, on one of them I even gave what people might think while shaking out sheets.

Get their names and addresses for me, so we can discuss documented evidence rather than the examples I gave which generalize documented evidence we have, such as people refusing to send their gay children to college or kicking them out of the house upon discovering they're gay. There were two point 4s, which is why I asked for clarification. You know that right? I'm sensing you're either intentionally misreading me or misrepresenting me, because I've already told you I did not say <&quot;>religious people don't make optimal choices to self improve<&quot;> which if that's what you're reading, somehow, as completely different from what I've written, it's not surprising you'd read anything as mocking. Instead, I actually said <&quot;>religious traditions can cause people to disregard personal development, and give justifications and distractions that are supposed to be more important than things like combatting discrimination.<&quot;>  
If it seems that way to you /u/Nepene, then I sympathize. Obviously it looks like a polemic against people. It's not. I just listed bad things that can happen, and have happened, and how they mirror bad things that can and have happened with drug use. Oh I see what you mean about the 7 years. I never claimed up top that opium causes people to live longer. Even if I had though, I'm sure a similar uncontrolled study could show it amongst some numbers of population. Also, are we talking people who have taken opium once and could reference how the effects can be metaphors for spiritual traditions, people who haven't taken opium but trust it, or people who take opium their whole life? I didn't specify, and I'm not sure which I'd be going off of. Probably at a distance. Your point linking 7 years to gay marriage and relating that back to spiritual traditions in the opiate of the masses sense really ignores all the points I made, don't you think? Aren't you narrowing down what I've said to try to mock me back for what you think is me mocking actual people? As far as universal characteristics go, obviously the connection is that spiritual traditions can make it easier, not that they're merely involved. Otherwise we could say fiction helps people with schizophrenia, or anything really. I'll take that as another misread. I am in fact not saying that. At this point I would love an honest retelling of what I've said before you ask for further <&quot;>clarification<&quot;> by extrapolation or respond. That is not my mental model. The connections between each point are easy to find, not reductive, not broad, and not generalized. They're just things that happen, ways they're justified, and the models that fit. Since you're fishing for an extra comparison, you could say <&quot;>lying<&quot;> is also the opiate of the masses, rather than not doing drugs, being gay, or reality for those who take drugs. Lying fits because you use it as the only basis for using it on things it caused, which means you tell yourself <&quot;>it works<&quot;> when it doesn't work but rather it is what happens when you work off of a confused version of reality where you pay the bug sprayer to deliver you from the roaches they put in your house. In fact, the only major difference for lying I've picked out so far is that no one gave it to you. With spiritual traditions someone gave you the tradition and the belief (like safety from hell) that you need it for, and addiction gives you the want to use the drug to handle your addiction, but no one gives you lying as an activity. You'd have to keep choosing it yourself from the start without any outside help, and then it can begin to justify itself.

But in the context of American history, a <&quot;>racist<&quot;> affirmative action policy uses race specfically to *correct* for prior ills made precisely on the basis of race, *not* economic status. 

From the [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/28KOTZL.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) of Ira Katznelson's <&quot;>When Affirmative Action was White<&quot;>:

&gt; But Katznelson demonstrates that African-American veterans received significantly less help from the G.I. Bill than their white counterparts.

By October 1946, 6,500 former soldiers had been placed in nonfarm jobs by the employment service in Mississippi; 86 percent of the skilled and semiskilled jobs were filled by whites, 92 percent of the unskilled ones by blacks.

The G.I. bill is only one example in a sea of exclusions -- even harsher perhaps was how jobs overwhelmingly taken up by blacks (not just veterans) were systematically excluded from new minimum wage laws introduced after WWII.

2x4oex,cowy2it,coxcxy8,n_607365,q_75136,"&gt; &gt;The way I understand it, it is mostly immune to counterfeit. Everyone (or at least, some sort of more centralized (hmmm, there's that word) clearing houses) keeps records of who has which coins, and coins (or parts of coins) have an ID that distinguishes them. However, I don't see how it isn't possible to try to pay for two things at once using the same coin, before the clearing houses have a chance to update each other's records. This isn't possible with regular money - if you make two transactions at the same time, both are going to get deducted from your account because there isn't an idea of money having ID tags.

The bitcoin system is *designed* to prevent double spending. The receiving end of the transaction waits until there is a consensus on the mining network that the transaction is legit and it is buried under enough work that invalidating it is practically infeasible. This does not happen instantly, merely quickly.

&gt;So lets talk about supposed decentralization. Bitcoin is definitely not perfectly decentralized - there are clearing houses who keep all the records (as opposed to every individual possessor of Bitcoins) so there is already a degree of centralization. What happens if there is ever a disjointedness in the network? Are disagreements between clearing houses always reconcilable? Are any individuals going to get screwed over when the network re-merges, and some transactions have to cancelled out in the records? What happens if all the records say a certain person (whatever <&quot;>person<&quot;> means) owns a certain coin, but that person in fact does not own that coin because of an offline transaction? With regular money, this is all trivial - worst case you can hand each other pieces of paper, and voila, you are the new owner of some money.

I'm not sure what would happen in the case of a network split. My basic understanding is that it is reconcilable, apart from double spending attempts. However I would like to point out that it would take a *catastrophic* failure for a split to happen big enough for transactions in the minority to keep going on like nothing happened.

&gt;At my federally insured bank, if all my money is somehow lost I get it all back. 
&gt;If someone steals my credit card, I can call the bank or credit company and have it cancelled. If a vendor doesn't send me the goods, I can call my credit card company and they will cancel the transaction. 

There's a choice to be made between reversible and irreversible transactions. Strictly reversible transactions offer protection against fraudulent outgoing transactions at the cost of protection for the (likely honest) payee. The current transaction system uses fees to insure both sides.

&gt;If someone steals my wallet full of cash, then sure I probably lose it, but how is this not equivalent to someone stealing my thumb drive full of Bitcoins?

Your bitcoin wallet can (and should) be password-protected, and you can (and should) keep a backup (or several). I've yet to see a cash wallet that offers that kind of security.

&gt;Quick note about transaction fees, since I think I'm making this post too long - if there are any transaction fees for Bitcoin, then people are crazy for using it. I have credit cards that pay me for using them.

Credit cards have fees, even if you don't get to see them as a customer. Banks typically charge a recurring fee for issuing credit cards, and merchants are charged 1-4% of all bank card transaction.

390o7o,crzcin7,crzru68,n_61364,q_8280,"&gt; CMV: States like Iowa and New Hampshire shouldn't have their caucuses/primaries earlier than the rest of the country.

In the US primary system, the Iowa Caucus and New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries take place before the every other state. This leads to those states having an outsized influence on national politics. For example, presidential candidates can't oppose corn subsidies without taking a beating in Iowa, and losing big in the first primary caucus of the election is terrible for a candidate's momentum. 

I think this is idiotic. People who live in Iowa or New Hampshire shouldn't be more important from an electoral standpoint than people who live in other states. So please, change my view and explain why states like Iowa and New Hampshire should continue receiving this priviledge. 

EDIT: I didn't clarify this on my original post, but I believe every state having a primary on the same day (a <&quot;>super-duper Tuesday,<&quot;> if you will) is the simplest and fairest solution.

EDIT #2: Delta awarded to top comment. I was presented with an argument I hadn't considered and I'm convinced.

33t6ee,cqofb4e,cqogj12,n_566330,q_69329,"&gt; &gt;I'll agree it's stupid, but from their point of view, the government forcing them to enable sodomy is like forcing their churches to marry gays.

While others have mentioned sodomy, I'll revisit it: it's a ridiculous point.  First, they were lesbians, the group least likely to engage in anal sex.  Second, anal sex is incredibly prevalent among heterosexuals, meaning that if they cater to weddings they've already enabled a hell of a lot of sodomy.  Finally, there are plenty of gay couples that *don't* engage in anal sex.  Gay sex =/= sodomy, and at any given moment there is waaaaay more heterosexual sodomy going on than all gay sex put together.

Setting that aside, consider the wider ramifications.  Would you support a similar argument from a furniture salesman?  Selling a gay couple a bed <&quot;>enables sodomy<&quot;> and all that wonderful gay sex a heck of a lot more than selling them a cake.  In fact, the same argument could be applied to virtually all goods and services depending on how far it's taken - do you feel it should *just* apply in this instance (i.e. to the wedding cake and similar) or would you describe your view more as <&quot;>it's acceptable for any company to refuse service to people based on their sexual orientation<&quot;>?  My guess is you're closer to the former, but I'm curious as to why and how you're drawing the line.

&gt; There are many more bakeries that would've happily fulfilled this couple's order, and will likely overtake them as a more inclusive brand. It's a first world problem par excellence, that a mom and pop establishment won't cater to a sexual minority almost exclusively recognized by the West.

You're confusing <&quot;>cater to<&quot;> with <&quot;>not discriminate against.<&quot;>  (Unless you meant <&quot;>cater<&quot;> in the more literal sense, but I don't think that was the intent.)  The couple didn't ask them to do anything special or unusual on account of their sexual orientation, all they wanted was the exact same service provided by everyone else.  Moreover, would you say the same thing if we were talking about gender or race?  Certainly, there are plenty of cake shops out there that will happily make a cake for pretty much anyone, but would you really be okay with a cake shop that posted a big sign in the window <&quot;>no, we don't serve (men/women/blacks/asians/whites/hispanics/whichever)<&quot;>?

If this had started because the couple pitched a fit over the shop not having a full selection of same-sex cake toppers (and not wanting to order them in, a service they don't typically provide), I'd be totally with you; nobody would condemn, say, a barber for telling a woman who came in <&quot;>no, I can't do a two-foot tall permed beehive for your prom, I don't even have the equipment for that.<&quot;>  However, them saying <&quot;>no, I won't give you the standard buzzcut because I don't cut women's hair<&quot;> would be a very different matter.  Shops aren't obligated to cater to every single group and demographic, nor should we set a legal precedent for people demanding that they change their service to accommodate them, but should we really be setting a precedent that people can be refused standard service because of their age/sex/gender/sexual orientation/race/nationality/religion/etc?

3i1kea,cucivau,cucj8nr,n_6505,q_899,"&gt; CMV: Allowing your prepubescent child to become severely over/underweight is child abuse.

It is absolutely essential to keep a child at a normal weight. Parents in this day and age should have advice and information on what healthy eating actually is. Allowing your kids to develop a condition such as obesity, which leads to severe cardiovascular damage on all levels and a shortened life, could be seen as bad parenting. Parental failure to provide their children with adequate treatment for a chronic illness (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc) is a well accepted reason for a child protection registration for neglect. I believe that childhood obesity become a child protection concern when parents behave in a way that actively promotes treatment failure in a child who is at serious risk from their weight and when the parents or carers understand what is required. Even though others may point out the existence of factors such as the marketing of unhealthy foods, the primary responsibility falls on the parents every time. Existing laws could be applied.",You understand why poor people can get fat right?,Cheap food (and cheap translates to time) is fattening.,"Many organic foods (like rice and beans) are cheap and healthy, parents not doing it is their choice and theirs alone.

Throughout history, many people have died for their beliefs and in many cases, we honor and remember these individuals for standing up for what is *right*.

The man who is put to death for admonishing the King may be forgotten, but his death might also cause others to stand up and confront what they were otherwise willing to let go.

I personally believe that there are plenty of times when it would be more appropriate to lie and live, than to be honest and die, but exceptions might exist for the opposite case a well.

It's tough to actually say what a person would do until they are put in that position, and sometimes people don't believe what they did even afterward.

I think there are cases for both sides of the argument, but it would be naÃ¯ve to say that a person's death has never sparked a bigger impact than if they had been alive.","I agree that in some cases a martyr might be necessary, but wouldn't a leader offer much more alive than dead?","People who lose their leaderships usually lose their courage as well.
